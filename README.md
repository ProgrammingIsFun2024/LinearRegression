This study aims to investigate the correlation between life expectancy and various predictive factors across four key domains: immunization-related factors, mortality factors, economic factors, and social factors. 
A total of 19 explanatory variables were carefully selected to construct the comprehensive model. By employing automatic selection and various regression techniques, three models were identified as potentially globally optimized, based on criteria such as Mallowâ€™s Cp, PRESSp, R_adjusted square, and AICp. 
Subsequently, model validation was performed for these three potentially optimized models. After comparing their descriptive and predictive capabilities, one model emerged as the optimal choice. 
The analysis was conducted using a combination of SPSS and Python.
